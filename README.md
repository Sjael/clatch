Internet Dashboard Browser

## To-Do

+ Click and drag to navigate horizontally (http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/mixedContentTouch.html)
+ Remember window position and if maximized on program start
+ Sign in handler (modal that brings up the sign-in page for feeds that require user data)
+ Make function that launches links in program instead of launching in default browser

* Might need to add Flash Pepper to browser to be able to run some content (Twitch player)
* New feeds (Facebook, Techcrunch, Product Hunt, etc.)
* Categorize different feeds in the 'Add Feed' modal, like a catalog
